	/// <summary>
	/// A unified way of starting and executing asynchronous tasks to avoid deadlocks.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// There are three rules that should be strictly followed when using or interacting
	/// with tasks that have UI/Main thread interaction requirements:
	/// 1. If a method has certain thread apartment requirements (STA or MTA) it must either:
	///		a)	Have an asynchronous signature, and asynchronously marshal to the appropriate
	///			thread if it isn't originally invoked on a compatible thread.
	///			The recommended way to switch to the main thread is:
	///			<code>
	///			await asyncManager.SwitchToMainThread();
	///			</code>
	///		b)	Have a synchronous signature, and throw an exception when called on the wrong thread.
	///			In particular, no method is allowed to synchronously marshal work to another thread
	///			(blocking while that work is done). Synchronous blocks in general are to be avoided
	///			whenever possible.
	/// 
	/// 2. When an implementation of an already-shipped public API must call asynchronous code
	/// and block for its completion, it must do so by following this simple pattern:
	///		<code>
	///		asyncManager.Run(async () => await SomeOperationAsync(...));
	///		</code>
	/// 
	/// 3. If ever awaiting work that was started earlier, that work must be Joined.
	/// For example, one service kicks off some asynchronous work that may later become
	/// synchronously blocking:
	///		<code>
	///		var longRunningAsyncWork = asyncManager.RunAsync(async () => await SomeOperationAsync(...));
	///		</code>
	/// 
	/// Then later that async work becomes blocking:
	/// <code>
	/// await longRunningAsyncWork;
	/// </code>
	/// </remarks>
